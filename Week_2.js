// Project: Week 2
// Class: Scalable Data Infrastructures

// Project has a main function in which all the functions will come back to an return
// a data type or do something.
// Will start with pseudocode that will actually get filled afterwards
// Project is me getting out of bed and working towards the rest of my day.
